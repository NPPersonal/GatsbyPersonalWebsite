Welcome to my personal website. This is the new version of my personal website
from [old version](https://nelsonpunch.netlify.app/) and still working in progress.

In this website you can find out more [about me](/about/) and what I did in personal
works. Moreover what I have learnt. I write [blogs](/blogs/) about topics from time to time.

In the past I had experiences in mobile app development in IOS platform. And trying
to expose myself about more knowledge in different area such as [Web development](/projects/web/)
and [Machine Learning](/projects/machine-learning/).

I am focusing on machine learning currently and keen to know more about it and integration
in real life.

Send me a [message or E-mail](/contact/message-me/) if you are interest or would like to discuss.
