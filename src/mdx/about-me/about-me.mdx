## Background

---

**I am born in Taiwan and studied information technology in Queensland
University of Technology. Software development always be my interest
since I was teenager. Therefore I have never stop learning in this field.**

**For years I am self-taught in different skills regardless of programming languages,
frameworks or tools because software development involve many components
in order to achieve final result. As long as skills can improve and solve problems
I am keen to learn.**

**For past few years I have experinced in native mobile app development
in IOS specifically both in company and freelancer. As cross-platform become
more popular, thus I shift myself toward it by learning cross-platorm development
framework such as [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).**

**Since artificial intelligent becoming more popular and can imporve life in future
potentially. I start to focus on machine learning and deep learning and how to integrate
it into software for real life application. For example a personal project such as
[this](https://braintumordetectorapp.streamlit.app/) a brain tumor detector.**
