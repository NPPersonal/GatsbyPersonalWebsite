## 背景

---

I am born in Taiwan and studied information technology in Queensland
University of Technology. Software development always be my interest
since I was teenager. Therefore I have never stop learning in this field.

<br />
<br />

For years I am self-taught in different skills regardless of programming languages,
frameworks or tools because software development involve many components
in order to achieve final result. As long as skills can improve and solve problems
I am keen to learn.

<br />
<br />

For past few years I have experinced in native mobile app development
in IOS specifically both in company and freelancer. As cross-platform become
more popular, thus I shift myself toward it by learning cross-platorm development
framework such as [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

<br />
<br />

Since artificial intelligent becoming more popular and can imporve life in future
potentially. I start to focus on machine learning and deep learning and how to integrate
it into software for real life application. For example a personal project such as
[this](https://braintumordetectorapp.streamlit.app/) a brain tumor detector.

## 程式語言

That would be great to learn onece and for all. However there is no such thing in reality.
Different frameworks or solutions might involve different programming languages. Following are
programming languages I have experienced.

- javascript
- python
- Objective-C
- Swift
- C#
- C++
- PHP

## 框架

Learning a framework take time but can be an excellent skill later during development or
could be a soluion to a problem.

<br />
<br />

These are primary frameworks I have had used on project and still learning.

- [IOS SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK): **software development kit for IOS platform**
- [React.js](https://react.dev/): **library for web development**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): **base on React.js and more features completed for web development**
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): **base on React.js with many plug-ins and great for content driven web
  such as this personal website**
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): **cross platform development framework for mobile app**
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): **minimal web framework for Node.js and capable of frontend and backend**
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): **a framework for machine learning**
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): **a framework for machine learning and popular in research area**
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): **a framework for machine learning and easy to get into machine learning field**
- [Codelgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/): **a light weight framework for PHP web**

Learning additional development tool and knowledge come in handy from time to time.
There are few tool and experiences I had.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control): **version control for source code**
- [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD): **continuous integration and continuous delivery such as
  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)**
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): **containerized light weight virtual machine**
- [Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database): **database such as [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and
  [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)**
- [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/): **a packages management for IOS development**
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): **a packages management for javascript**
