<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

**This is a human brain tumor detector app that can identify 3 types of tumor.
Given a medical MRI image, app will analyse the image and return an analysed result.
The result indicate whether there is a tumor detected or not with probability.\
The purpose of the app is to take advantage of machine learning to assist medical professional
or patient in brain tumor detection.**
