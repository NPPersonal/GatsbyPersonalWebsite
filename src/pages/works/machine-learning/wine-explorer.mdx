## Introduction

---

**A wine explorer app. Help you to explore wines by your description or possible find
the one you are looking for.**

**You just have a taste of a wine and have no clues and no ideas about a wine.
You eager to find out about the wine and looking for similar wines. This app
might help you to explore more similar wines and possible find the wine your are
lokking for. All you need is your description of your taste about the wine**

**This app learn from sommeliers on a large set of wines then analyse your
description and try to find possible wines for you**

<br />

## Motivation & Purpose

---

**Looking for wines you like is like picking needle from ocean. Looking through
bunch of reviews is a pain or sometime your have no clues where to start.**

**Translating from description of wine or desire of your wine should be into
a keywords for searching wines might be a solution regardless of taste of wine
is vary from person to person.**

<br />

## Detail

---

**The machine learning model was trained with dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews).**

**Two models were produced old model and new model. The old model was trained with supervise learning while
new model was trained with unsupervise learning. Both models find the similarity of description to predouce
final result.**

**Frameworks were used to build this app:**

- **[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)** : machine learning framework for model
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** : backend with frontend app for new version
- **[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)** : frontend app for old version
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** : containerized backend for old version

<br />

## Note

---

**The models find wines base on similarity of your description and
there are many factors could effect the result. Therefore wines you
found might not be 100% your are looking for.**

**Old version only provide wine's title, country, score, price and description.
Backend server often put to sleep if no interaction for period of time. Therefore
website(frontend) will take a while to wait for server to wake up to be able to function.**

**New version only provide wine's location information.**
